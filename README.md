# String Functions Project C#
By creating a class I create different methods (functions) of string, for example:
to find the number of elements in a string,
to join strings,
to add between a string,
to get an element from the string,
to trim a string,
to convert a string into a char,
to reverse a string,
to sort from A to Z,
to sort from Z to A.
